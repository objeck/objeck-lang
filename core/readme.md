![alt text](../docs/images/toolchain.svg "Objeck System Architecture")

### Notable Subsystems
* [Compiler](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/blob/master/core/compiler)
* [Virtual Machine](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/blob/master/core/vm)
* [Debugger](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/blob/master/core/debugger)
* [REPL](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/blob/master/core/repl)
* [Memory manager](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/blob/master/core/vm/arch)
* [Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/blob/master/core/vm/arch/jit)

## Working with the Code
Objeck can be built for a variety of targets. The language is implemented in C++, assembly (i.e., generated machine code) and assisted by code generators for bindings to SDL2 and GTK 3/4.

### Linux (x64, ARM64)
*  For Linux, install required libraries: <code>sudo apt-get install build-essential git libssl-dev unixodbc-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libreadline-dev unzip</code>
*  cd to <code>objeck-lang/core/release</code> and run <code>./deploy_posix.sh</code> with the parameter <code>64</code> or <code>rpi</code> for x64 or ARM64 Linux
*  Build output with binaries and documentation will be located in <code>objeck-lang/core/release/deploy</code>
*  Reference <code>objeck-lang/core/release/deploy/readme.html</code> to set additional paths and find examples

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
*  Install Xcode with command line tools
*  Open a command shell and go to <code>objeck-lang/core/release</code> and run <code>./deploy_macos_arm64.sh</code>
*  Build output with binaries and documentation will be located in <code>objeck-lang/core/release/deploy</code>
*  Reference <code>objeck-lang/core/release/deploy/readme.html</code> to set additional paths and find examples

### Windows (Visual Studio)
*  Unzip the OpenSSL Windows libraries in <code>objeck-lang/core/lib/openssl/win/x64</code>
*  Using Visual Studio 2022 or later open <code>objeck-lang/core/release/objeck.sln</code>
*  Ensure the core build completes successfully (in Release mode)
*  To build everything, open a Visual Studio x64 command prompt and go to <code>objeck-lang/core/release</code> directory and run <code>deploy_amd64.cmd</code>
*  Build output with binaries and documentation will be located in <code>objeck-lang/core/release/deploy64</code>
*  Reference <code>objeck-lang/core/release/deploy64/readme.html</code> to learn how to set the environment variables and find code examples

### Windows (MSYS2)
* Under the UCRT64 (Unicode shell support)
  * Package dependencies
  * <code>pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-lld mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-openssl make mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2 unzip mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2_ttf mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2_mixer mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2_image mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-unixodbc</code>
