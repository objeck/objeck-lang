## What's New

### v2026.9.5 ✅
  * **Linux ARM64 runs on every ARM64 CPU** &mdash; v2026.9.4 was built for the build server's CPU and needed its SVE instructions, so it stopped with "Illegal instruction" on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, Graviton2, Snapdragon X or Apple silicon in a Linux VM. It now targets ARMv8-A at no measured cost, and CI runs every build on an emulated CPU without SVE ([#893](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/issues/893))
  * **Programs with threads exit and join safely** &mdash; a runtime error or `Runtime->Exit` while another thread ran crashed the VM after printing its message, on every platform ([#877](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/issues/877)); `Thread->Join` could fail with "Unable to join thread!" when a collection ran while it waited ([#874](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/issues/874))
  * **Garbage collector** &mdash; a closure's captured values could be freed while still held ([#881](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/issues/881)), plus fixes for objects lost at the end of a small nursery, a thread-exit race and objects allocated at twice their size. A heap verifier (`OBJECK_GC_VERIFY`) checks the collector's invariants and runs nightly on all five platforms
  * **Sorting** &mdash; `Int->Sort` and its `Float`, `Char` and `Byte` counterparts could exhaust the call stack on input of a particular shape; they are about 15% faster, `ArraySort->Sort` sorts an array in place, and `Data.CSV` medians are about 12 times faster ([#887](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/issues/887))
  * **Compiler** &mdash; dozens of fixes for lambdas, enums and conditional expressions, most found by holding every test to the same output across optimization levels and JIT settings, and by a program fuzzer
  * **Integer arithmetic has one definition** &mdash; shared by the interpreter, compiler and both JITs. `INT64_MIN / -1` no longer stops the program, and `>>>` takes its shift count modulo 64 like `<<` and `>>`, so `-1 >>> 64` is `-1` rather than `0`

### v2026.9.4
  * **Integer division by a power of two rounded the wrong way at `-opt s2` and `s3`** &mdash; strength reduction turned `n / 2^k` on a local into an arithmetic shift, which rounds toward negative infinity where division truncates toward zero: `-7 / 2` gave `-4`. Division is no longer rewritten; both JITs already compile a constant divisor correctly. Programs compiled at `s2` or `s3` (the default) by v2026.9.3 or earlier should be recompiled
  * **`1 / n` evaluated to `n` at `-opt s3`** &mdash; a peephole pattern meant for `x / 1` matched the left operand instead, so `1 / 5` gave `5`. The pattern is gone
  * **The compiler crashed folding `INT64_MIN / -1`** &mdash; `obc` exited with no message and no output file; that fold is left to run time now
  * **Deserializing an object array with a Nil element corrupted its object** &mdash; each Nil element was written into the object's next field instead of the array, so the array read back as Nil and later fields shifted

### v2026.9.3
  * **macOS installs need nothing else** &mdash; every macOS release since v2026.6.3 linked Homebrew's GnuTLS and ngtcp2, plus an ngtcp2 GnuTLS backend Homebrew does not ship, so `obr` stopped at launch on any Mac but the build machine; v2026.9.2's OpenCV, ONNX and LAME bindings needed Homebrew formulas too. HTTP/3's TLS moves to AWS-LC, linked statically into `obr` on Linux and macOS with ngtcp2, nghttp3 and nghttp2, and the `.pkg` carries OpenCV, ONNX Runtime, mbedTLS, libiodbc and LAME. It runs on macOS 13.3 or later, the ONNX binding on macOS 14 ([#812](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/812), [#817](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/817))
  * **ARM64: a collection could corrupt an object under multithreaded load** &mdash; the collector set the mark bit below any nursery address its conservative scans found, including the stale and interior pointers compiled ARM64 code leaves on the stack. For a map's tree node that turned an empty `@right` into 1, and a later lookup crashed: silently or with "Invalid object cast" on Windows arm64, with SIGSEGV on macOS and Linux arm64. It marks only real object starts now ([#821](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/821), [#816](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/issues/816))
  * **Linux archives install their whole runtime** &mdash; `install_deps.sh` installed SDL2 alone, so the other bindings failed to load on a fresh machine; it now maps every library the binaries link to its package, and `--check` reports what is missing ([#809](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/809))
  * **ODBC says why a connection did not open** &mdash; `Connection->GetLastError()` was empty after a failed connect; it returns the driver manager's diagnostic, e.g. `[IM002] ... Data source name not found` ([#819](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/819))
  * **Licenses ship with the code they cover** &mdash; the AWS-LC, ngtcp2, nghttp3 and nghttp2 code inside `obr`, and the libraries the macOS package carries, ship their license files in `doc/licenses` ([#818](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/818))
  * **Every platform is verified before a tag** &mdash; one script per machine builds a clean checkout the way the release does and runs the regression suite with the default JIT and with every method compiled, plus the VM flag, debugger and DAP tests; install instructions are checked against the libraries the binaries link; a dispatched Release Build can no longer publish; and a test that did not run no longer counts as a pass ([#814](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/814), [#808](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/808), [#819](https://github.com/objeck/objeck-lang/pull/819))

> **Note:** Windows installers are signed and timestamped (`CN=Randy Hollines`, Sectigo); the macOS `.pkg` is signed and notarized. Signing uses a hardware token and therefore happens locally after publication, so verify rather than assume — `Get-AuthenticodeSignature <file>.msi` reports `Valid` only when it really is signed. Check any download against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, which is regenerated after signing. Builds are automated on GitHub Actions runners.
