# Changelog

All notable changes to Objeck will be documented in this file.

## [v2026.5.0] - 2026-05-06

### New Features
- **Face recognition** (`FaceSession`): SCRFD 10G-KPS face detector + ArcFace R50 512-dim embedding recognizer from InsightFace buffalo_l pack. Cross-platform: DirectML (Windows), CPU/CUDA (Linux), CoreML (macOS). No additional native libraries required.
- **Windows emoji support**: Full Unicode supplementary plane output (emoji and other non-BMP characters) now works correctly in cmd.exe and Windows Terminal. Console string/char output routes through `WriteConsoleW` so surrogate pairs arrive intact; pipe and file redirection continue to emit correct UTF-8 bytes.

### Libraries
- **ONNX**: New `FaceSession`, `FaceDetectionResult`, `FaceRecognitionResult`, `FaceDetection`, `FaceResult` classes. `FaceSession->Compare()` computes cosine similarity between embeddings (>0.35 = same person).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Windows console output corrupting characters above U+FFFF — surrogate pairs were split by `std::wcout` causing each half to render as U+FFFD. Fixed via `WinWriteWide` helper using `WriteConsoleW` for live console handles.
- Fixed Windows console code page — `SetConsoleCP`/`SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)` now called at startup so pipe/redirect output is interpreted correctly.

### Documentation
- Expanded `core/lib/onnx/README.md` with platform/EP matrix, quick-start examples, and demo list.
- Updated `core/lib/onnx/MODELS.md` with SCRFD + ArcFace download instructions, Linux CPU/CUDA and macOS CoreML runtime sections.

## [v2026.4.3] - 2026-04-12

### New Features
- **DAP debugger hover**: Hovering an object shows `ClassName { field=val, ... }` with one-level instance field expansion via `FormatObjectForDap`
- **DAP instance/class variable scopes**: Variables pane now shows separate Locals, Instance, and Class scopes with correct memory mapping
- **Configurable JIT threshold**: Auto-JIT invocation count can now be tuned at startup
- **Editor setup refresh**: Updated VS Code, Sublime Text, and gvim/Vim DAP+LSP setup for Windows, Linux, and macOS with per-platform instructions

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed DAP step-into crash, step-over/step-out scoping, and disconnect access violation
- Fixed DAP stdout/stderr corruption — redirected program output through capture pipes so DAP protocol stream stays clean
- Fixed DAP variable display, source path resolution, and pipe crashes
- Fixed DAP variable memory mapping to match CLI debugger
- Fixed LSP server crash on `textDocument/codeAction` with inferred locals
- Fixed LSP hover position conversion from 1-based to 0-based
- Fixed JIT S2F callback param count causing segfault on `String:ToFloat`
- Hardened HTTPS client against null `ReadLine` on connection failures

### Infrastructure
- DAP integration test suite (`programs/regression/run_dap_tests.sh`)
- Removed redundant `HandleEvaluate` fallback in DAP adapter (consolidated into `EvaluateForDap`)

## [v2026.4.2] - 2026-04-06

### New Features
- **JIT local variable register cache** (AMD64 + ARM64): Keeps values in registers after store, avoids redundant reloads, evicts on demand when register pool is exhausted — ~3x speedup across all benchmarks
- **DTLS (Datagram TLS) support**: New `DTLSSocket` and `DTLSSocketServer` classes for secure UDP communication (IoT, VoIP, gaming)
- **Editor guide**: New `docs/editors.md` with Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Neovim, and DAP debugging setup

### Libraries

- **OpenAI API**: New `Embedding` class, `Models` constants (GPT-4.1, O3, O4-mini)
- **ML library**: Fixed EuclideanDistance/StdDev bugs, added `LinearRegression` and `LogisticRegression`
- Hardened JSON, JSON stream, and XML parsers against malformed input
- Hardened HTTPS client against null ReadLine on connection failures

### Performance
- **Link-time optimization**: Added `-flto=auto` across all GCC Makefiles (AMD64 and ARM64)
- **ARM64 native CPU tuning**: `-mcpu=native` auto-detects RPi5 (Cortex-A76) and Jetson Orin (Cortex-A78AE)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed doc generator error on `@hidden` tag

## [v2026.4.1] - 2026-04-05

### Changes

- **Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)**: Full VS Code debugging support with breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection, and stack traces
- **Conditional Breakpoints**: Break on expressions (e.g., `b file.obs:30 when count > 5`)
- **Debugger ANSI Colors**: Syntax-highlighted source listing with color-coded breakpoints, current line, and line numbers
- **Readline Support**: Command history and line editing in the interactive debugger
- **macOS .pkg Installer**: Signed and notarized native package installer with PATH auto-configuration
- **SSE Streaming**: Server-Sent Events support for HTTP client/server

- **MTHD_CALL JIT whitelist** (x64 + ARM64): Methods containing method calls can now be JIT-compiled
- **GC thread safety**: Memory barriers in PushFrame/PopFrame paired with acquire fences in GC marking — fixes intermittent threading segfaults on Linux
- **JIT instance method inlining fix**: Save/restore INSTANCE_MEM around inlined code

### Networking & I/O
- Socket default receive timeouts to prevent hung connections
- Fixed ReadBytes partial read bug (short reads no longer silently truncated)
- HTTP client/server stack hardening with loopback regression tests

### Libraries
- **OpenCV**: Contours, VideoWriter, transforms, normalization, 15 new image processing functions
- **ODBC**: Transactions, error handling, schema discovery, BigInt support
- **ONNX**: Phi-3 Vision multimodal inference, unified build system (DML/CUDA/QNN/CoreML)
- **Collections**: Hash auto-resize at 75% load, Vector in-place Remove
- **JSON**: Escape and keyword parsing fixes

### CI/CD & Infrastructure

## [v2026.2.1] - 2026-02-26

### New Features
- **Try/Otherwise Error Handling**: `Try()` and `Otherwise()` compiler intrinsics on the `Base` class for safe method chaining with graceful error recovery (e.g., `obj->Try()->Method()->Otherwise(default)`)

### Performance Optimizations
- **4.38x speedup on nbody benchmark** via increased method inline limit (128→256 bytes), allowing getter/setter-heavy code to be fully inlined and JIT-optimized
- **Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)**: New compiler pass at s2+ eliminates redundant computations within basic blocks
- **Dead Code Elimination**: New compiler pass removes redundant jumps to immediately-following labels
- **Bug Fix**: Division-by-zero crash in constant folding — `DIV_INT`/`MOD_INT` now guards against zero divisor
- **Bug Fix**: Dead condition in `InstructionReplacement` — `&&` corrected to `||` (both types could never match simultaneously)
- **JIT Safety**: Division-by-zero guards added to `ProcessIntFold` in both x64 and ARM64 JIT backends
- **Fixed Try/Otherwise crash**: VM segfault when calling non-virtual methods (e.g., `Size()`, `ToUpper()`) on Nil objects inside `Try()` chains — call stack and instruction pointer now properly unwound during error recovery
- **Fixed debugger build error on Windows**: `HELP_COMMAND` enum collision with Windows SDK macro (`WinUser.h`)
- **Benchmarks**: 10 new performance benchmark programs with measurement tooling ([details](docs/performance.md))

### Improvements
- **Editor Syntax Highlighting**: Updated Monaco (playground) and VSCode syntax definitions to support `Try` and `Otherwise` as built-in keywords
- **Web Playground**: Updated version tag and editor keyword support for v2026
- **ARM64 CI Testing**: Enabled Linux ARM64 (`ubuntu-24.04-arm64`) and macOS ARM64 test execution in GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: Bootstrap & cross-platform build workflow documented in `core/readme.md`

### Internal
- Refactored Try/Otherwise from expression-level keywords to method intrinsics on `Base` class for cleaner semantics
- Removed disabled legacy CI workflow (superseded by `ci-build.yml`)
- Refactored `OptimizeMethod()` with `RunPass` helper for cleaner pass management
